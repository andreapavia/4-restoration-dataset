# 4 Restoration: dataset

4 Restoration is a small data manipulation and visualization project. Its data comes from an italian TV show, [4 ristoranti](https://programmi.sky.it/alessandro-borghese-4-ristoranti).

The data collected here is about the show's seasons, episodes, winnders, rating and air data. It will be used as mock-up to create charts, manipulate data and whatever other usage it could have.
