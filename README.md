# 4 Restoration: dataset

4 Restoration is a small data manipulation and visualization project. Its data comes from an italian TV show, [4 ristoranti](https://programmi.sky.it/alessandro-borghese-4-ristoranti).

The data collected here is about the show's seasons, episodes, winnders, rating and air data. It will be used as mock-up to create charts, manipulate data and whatever other usage it could have.

## How it works

The index.js file is just a call to a scrape() function. This function handles the "scraping" process, aka getting relevant information from the HTML source
file. Said information is parsed and manipulated into a JSON format to create the dataset, the final product of this process. The dataset will ultimately be used for a small data visualization experimentation with (possibly) [visx](https://airbnb.io/visx/)
